title: Best practice for everyone in podcasting

## An open ecosystem with best practice

A work in progress, this website is intended to be a non-opinionated guide to being the best citizen in the open podcast ecosystem. It is a Github website, open for anyone to edit, add to, or debate.

Give feedback by either [opening an 'issue'](https://github.com/jamescridland/podinfra.net/issues) or by submitting a pull request with an edit.

### Language used here

This website is guided by **independence, pragmatism and minimalism**. Minimum features should be simple to implement and require no specific skills or libraries.

"Ensure" - this is **the minimum that the industry expects.** While you won't be blocked for not doing this (in most cases), you'll show respect for the ecosystem if you complete these bare minimum requirements.

"Consider" - it **would be great if you can also do this.** Not every part of the ecosystem relies on this, but advanced podcasters and hosting companies will make use of additional features if you can implement them.
