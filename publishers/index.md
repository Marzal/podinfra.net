This is a temporary page for now, but it includes the following pieces of good advice...



## Help listeners know what's in your show
* If your episode or podcast is explicit, mark it as such in with your hosting provider/RSS feed.

## Use keywords wisely
* Name your podcast clearly to help a listener know what it's about
* With your any of your text fields with your podcast -- episode title, podcast title, episode description, podcast description -- you should absolutely optimize for SEO, but don't keyword stuff; you may be removed from some directories.
